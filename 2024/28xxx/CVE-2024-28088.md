# [CVE-2024-28088](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-28088)

## Description

- `LangChain through 0.1.10 allows ../ directory traversal by an actor who is able to control the final part of the path parameter in a load_chain call. This bypasses the intended behavior of loading configurations only from the hwchase17/langchain-hub GitHub repository. The outcome can be disclosure of an API key for a large language model online service, or remote code execution.`
