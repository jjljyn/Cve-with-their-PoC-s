# [CVE-2018-13410](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-13410)

## Description

- `Info-ZIP Zip 3.0, when the -T and -TT command-line options are used, allows attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid free and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact because of an off-by-one error. NOTE: it is unclear whether there are realistic scenarios in which an untrusted party controls the -TT value, given that the entire purpose of -TT is execution of arbitrary commands`
