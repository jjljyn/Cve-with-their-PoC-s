# [CVE-2018-16888](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-16888)

## Description

- `It was discovered systemd does not correctly check the content of PIDFile files before using it to kill processes. When a service is run from an unprivileged user (e.g. User field set in the service file), a local attacker who is able to write to the PIDFile of the mentioned service may use this flaw to trick systemd into killing other services and/or privileged processes. Versions before v237 are vulnerable.`
