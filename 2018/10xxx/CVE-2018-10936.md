# [CVE-2018-10936](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10936)

## Description

- `A weakness was found in postgresql-jdbc before version 42.2.5. It was possible to provide an SSL Factory and not check the host name if a host name verifier was not provided to the driver. This could lead to a condition where a man-in-the-middle attacker could masquerade as a trusted server by providing a certificate for the wrong host, as long as it was signed by a trusted CA.`
