# [CVE-2016-0800](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0800)

## Description

- `The SSLv2 protocol, as used in OpenSSL before 1.0.1s and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2g and other products, requires a server to send a ServerVerify message before establishing that a client possesses certain plaintext RSA data, which makes it easier for remote attackers to decrypt TLS ciphertext data by leveraging a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle, aka a "DROWN" attack.`
