# [CVE-2021-31805](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-31805)

## Description

- `The fix issued for CVE-2020-17530 was incomplete. So from Apache Struts 2.0.0 to 2.5.29, still some of the tagâ€™s attributes could perform a double evaluation if a developer applied forced OGNL evaluation by using the %{...} syntax. Using forced OGNL evaluation on untrusted user input can lead to a Remote Code Execution and security degradation.`
