## Description

- `The web management console of CheckMK Raw Edition (versions 1.5.0 to 1.6.0) allows a misconfiguration of the web-app Dokuwiki (installed by default), which allows embedded php code. As a result, remote code execution is achieved. Successful exploitation requires access to the web management interface, either with valid credentials or with a hijacked session by a user with the role of administrator.`
