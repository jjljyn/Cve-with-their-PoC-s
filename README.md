# CVE With their PoC`s repository

This repository contains a collection of CVE vulnerabilities from 1999 to 2024, along with links to GitHub PoC's. Each year is divided into subfolders based on the ID of the vulnerability, with the structure as follows:

* Year (e.g. 2015)
	+ ID (e.g. 1xxx)
		- CVE-ID (e.g. CVE-2015-1992)

For example, if a CVE with ID 2015-1992 comes in, it will be stored in the 2015 folder and the 1xxx subfolder.
