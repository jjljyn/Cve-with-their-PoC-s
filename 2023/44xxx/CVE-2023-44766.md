## Description

- `A Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Concrete CMS v.9.2.1 allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code via a crafted script to the SEO - Extra from Page Settings. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because this SEO-related header change can only be made by an admin, and allowing an admin to place JavaScript there is an intentional customization feature.`
