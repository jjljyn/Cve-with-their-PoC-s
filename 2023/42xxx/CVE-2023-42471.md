# [CVE-2023-42471](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-42471)

## Description

- `The wave.ai.browser application through 1.0.35 for Android allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code via a crafted intent. It contains a manifest entry that exports the wave.ai.browser.ui.splash.SplashScreen activity. This activity uses a WebView component to display web content and doesn't adequately validate or sanitize the URI or any extra data passed in the intent by a third party application (with no permissions).`
