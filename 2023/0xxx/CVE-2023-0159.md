## Description

- `The Extensive VC Addons for WPBakery page builder WordPress plugin before 1.9.1 does not validate a parameter passed to the php extract function when loading templates, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to override the template path to read arbitrary files from the hosts file system. This may be escalated to RCE using PHP filter chains.`
