# [CVE-2023-38408](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38408)

## Description

- `The PKCS#11 feature in ssh-agent in OpenSSH before 9.3p2 has an insufficiently trustworthy search path, leading to remote code execution if an agent is forwarded to an attacker-controlled system. (Code in /usr/lib is not necessarily safe for loading into ssh-agent.) NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-10009.`
