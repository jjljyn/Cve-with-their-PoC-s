## Description

- `The BackupWordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to information disclosure in versions up to, and including 3.12.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above to retrieve back-up paths that can subsequently be used to download the back-up.`
