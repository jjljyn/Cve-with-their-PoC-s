# [CVE-2022-2639](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-2639)

## Description

- `An integer coercion error was found in the openvswitch kernel module. Given a sufficiently large number of actions, while copying and reserving memory for a new action of a new flow, the reserve_sfa_size() function does not return -EMSGSIZE as expected, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds write access. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.`
