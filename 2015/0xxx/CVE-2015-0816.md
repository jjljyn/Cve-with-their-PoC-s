## Description

- `Mozilla Firefox before 37.0, Firefox ESR 31.x before 31.6, and Thunderbird before 31.6 do not properly restrict resource: URLs, which makes it easier for remote attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code with chrome privileges by leveraging the ability to bypass the Same Origin Policy, as demonstrated by the resource: URL associated with PDF.js.`
