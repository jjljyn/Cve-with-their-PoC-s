- `The CMP for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the cmp_get_post_detail(), niteo_export_csv(), and cmp_disable_comingsoon_ajax() functions in versions up to, and including, 3.8.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read posts, export subscriber lists, and/or deactivate the plugin.`
