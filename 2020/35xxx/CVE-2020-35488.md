# [CVE-2020-35488](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-35488)

## Description

- `The fileop module of the NXLog service in NXLog Community Edition 2.10.2150 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a crafted Syslog payload to the Syslog service. This attack requires a specific configuration. Also, the name of the directory created must use a Syslog field. (For example, on Linux it is not possible to create a .. directory. On Windows, it is not possible to create a CON directory.)`
