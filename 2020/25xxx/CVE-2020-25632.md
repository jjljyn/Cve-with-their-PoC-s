# [CVE-2020-25632](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-25632)

## Description

- `A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. The rmmod implementation allows the unloading of a module used as a dependency without checking if any other dependent module is still loaded leading to a use-after-free scenario. This could allow arbitrary code to be executed or a bypass of Secure Boot protections. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.`
