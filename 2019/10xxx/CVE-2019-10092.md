# [CVE-2019-10092](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-10092)

## Description

- `In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.0-2.4.39, a limited cross-site scripting issue was reported affecting the mod_proxy error page. An attacker could cause the link on the error page to be malformed and instead point to a page of their choice. This would only be exploitable where a server was set up with proxying enabled but was misconfigured in such a way that the Proxy Error page was displayed.`
