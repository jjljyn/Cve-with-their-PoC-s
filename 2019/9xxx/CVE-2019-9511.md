# [CVE-2019-9511](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9511)

## Description

- `Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to window size manipulation and stream prioritization manipulation, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker requests a large amount of data from a specified resource over multiple streams. They manipulate window size and stream priority to force the server to queue the data in 1-byte chunks. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both.`
