# [CVE-2019-9506](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9506)

## Description

- `The Bluetooth BR/EDR specification up to and including version 5.1 permits sufficiently low encryption key length and does not prevent an attacker from influencing the key length negotiation. This allows practical brute-force attacks (aka "KNOB") that can decrypt traffic and inject arbitrary ciphertext without the victim noticing.`
