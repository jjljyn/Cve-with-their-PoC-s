# [CVE-2019-9516](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9516)

## Description

- `Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a header leak, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker sends a stream of headers with a 0-length header name and 0-length header value, optionally Huffman encoded into 1-byte or greater headers. Some implementations allocate memory for these headers and keep the allocation alive until the session dies. This can consume excess memory.`
