## Description

- `Hydra through 0.1.8 has a NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash when processing POST requests that lack a Content-Length header. read.c, request.c, and util.c contribute to this. The process_header_end() function calls boa_atoi(), which ultimately calls atoi() on a NULL pointer.`
