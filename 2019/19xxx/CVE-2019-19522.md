# [CVE-2019-19522](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-19522)

## Description

- `OpenBSD 6.6, in a non-default configuration where S/Key or YubiKey authentication is enabled, allows local users to become root by leveraging membership in the auth group. This occurs because root's file can be written to /etc/skey or /var/db/yubikey, and need not be owned by root.`
