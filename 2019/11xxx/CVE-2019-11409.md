## Description

- `app/operator_panel/exec.php in the Operator Panel module in FusionPBX 4.4.3 suffers from a command injection vulnerability due to a lack of input validation that allows authenticated non-administrative attackers to execute commands on the host. This can further lead to remote code execution when combined with an XSS vulnerability also present in the FusionPBX Operator Panel module.`
