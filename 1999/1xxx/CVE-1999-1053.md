# [CVE-1999-1053](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-1999-1053)

## Description

- `guestbook.pl cleanses user-inserted SSI commands by removing text between "<!--" and "-->" separators, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands when guestbook.pl is run on Apache 1.3.9 and possibly other versions, since Apache allows other closing sequences besides "-->".`
